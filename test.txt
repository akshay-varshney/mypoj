And then the geo feature came to block Row build in China and block 2144 build outside China.

The kill switch feature seems has not been released and keep disabled all the time.

The old out of date (45/90 days) feature is also applicable for Row and 2144 build in China region and only enabled in d build. And the old out of date feature seems also target to block Row build in China. It's be replaced by geo feature after geo feature came.
